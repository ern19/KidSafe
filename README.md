KidSafe

A React on Rails based web app designed to keep your kids' screentime educational. I was inspired to make this for my 3yo daughter and for my friends and family with children. While I'm not one to blindly trust content from the internet, I was shocked when I saw the things that passed for kids content on Youtube. I wanted to create something that allows kids to have a safe, educational and constructive experience with streaming content on Youtube.

Parents can create a profile and add multiple kids each with unique viewing options. Parent's personal info is secured using Devise Token Auth.

Technologies used: Rails, React, PostgresDB/ActiveRecord, MaterialUI, Axios, Youtube IFrame API, Devise Token Auth, Git/Github

Ideas for v2: I'd like to add more Youtube API integration and allow parents to search for more content within the app. I'm also exploring more ways to add more tactile content to KidSafe to closer mimic the Youtube experience. Additionally, I'm planning to undergo some UX/UI testing with my daughter and her friends so I can decide what else to add to the app. However, I've yet to determine how to quantify feedback from 3-5 year olds.
